I have a skeleton in a closet and I have to make this sentence long enough to make an overflow what am I doing I don't know. 
I have to do laundary, but I don't know what to write in this text. 
I dreamed a dream in times gone by when hope was high and life worh living
I dreamed, that love would never die I dreamed that God would be forgiving   
 But the tigers come at night
